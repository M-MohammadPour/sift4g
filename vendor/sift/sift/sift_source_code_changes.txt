File, Description
Alignment.c, added #include <assert.h>, removed #define MAXSEQ 400
Alignment.h, added #include "blimps/blocksprogs.h", added #define MAXSEQ 400
Array_math.c, removed ifndef guards, added #include <assert.h> and #include "Array_math.h"
Array_math.h, new file (because inclusion of source files often means trouble)
constants.h, new file containing structures from blimps/docs needed in PN_convert.c
info_on_seqs_pid.c, replaced source code inclusion with header files, replaced gets with fgets
info_on_seqs_pid.h, new file (contains functions defined in info_on_seqs_pid.c, needed for library creation)
main.c, new file (extracted from info_on_seqs_pid.c, contains only getArgs function and calls function from info_on_seqs_pid.c)
Matrix_Info.c, replaced source code inclusion with header files
Matrix_Info.h, added #include "blimps/blocksprogs.h"
PN_blocks.c, replaced source code inclusion with header files, added #include <assert.h>; repalcedp pointers with NULL when removing sequences which identitiy is larger than some percentage to be able to free them properly
PN_blocks.h, replaced source code inclusion with header files, added #include "blimps/blocksprogs.h" and #define MAXSEQ 400
PN_convert.c, replaced source code inclusion with header files, added #include "constants.h", commented every occurrence of blimps_dir and now structures are initialized with values from constants.h, removed static keyword from stuff mentioned bellow; Solver memory leak by adding free(pssm->values[0]) on several places
PN_convert.h, added #include <stdio.h> , #include "blimps/blocksprogs.h", removed static from struct working *make_col() and void counts(), added int count_residues(col);
Psiblast.c, replaced source code inclusion with header files
Psiblast.h, added #include "blimps/blocksprogs.h"
queue.h, added #include <stdio.h>
SortList.c, added < #include <assert.h> and #include "PN_convert.h"
SortList.h, added #include "blimps/blocksprogs.h"
stringhash.c, replaced source code inclusion with header files, moved definitions ListNode, List and HashTbl to stringhash.h
stringhash.h, moved definitions ListNode, List and HashTbl from stringhash.c
